Arcum Concept Framework
================================================================================
Arcum is a plug-in for Eclipse to let you define your own refactorings.

This plug-in depends on google-collect-snapshot-20071022.jar and guice-1.0.jar.
But these dependencies will soon go away.

For more information on Arcum, read:
  Macneil Shonle, William G. Griswold, and Sorin Lerner. Beyond refactoring: a
  framework for modular maintenance of crosscutting design idioms. In
  Proceedings of the 6th Joint Meeting of the European Software Engineering
  Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software
  Engineering (ESEC-FSE '07; September 3-7, 2007). 175-184.
